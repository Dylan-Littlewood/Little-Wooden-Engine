# Welcome To Littlewood Engine
This is my first attempt at writing a full game engine in C++ by myself, so I hope this project turns out well!
I will be using the game engine series by [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw "The Cherno's Channel") on Youtube for help with this, his channel can be found by clicking the link.

I have been interested in building a game engine for quite a while now but have finely decided to start on the project. This will be a really big project but i hope to be able to get it to a working stage at some point.
