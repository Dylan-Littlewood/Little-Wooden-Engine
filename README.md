# Welcome To Littlewood Engine
This is my first attempt at writing a full game engine in C++ by myself, so I hope this project turns out well!
i will be using the game engine series by [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw "The Cherno's Channel") on Youtube for help with this, his channel can be found by clicking the link.
